in this project you will need :

- 2 containers

- pytho using  Flask library 

- Redis server 
*******************************

*****How it works******


first : python flask code 

we will import the library time to give the server 500 milli second to recover if the connection fails 

importing the flask library 

creating a connection to the redis server and using its defualt port 

defining a functioin that set the variable retries to 5 if and error happend we will raise the exeption 
and substracting 1 from the left tries so the user can try to load the web app 5 times if an error happend 

if the connection was succesfull the visit count will appear in the screen 

if statment to check if the scrip is being run directly if not it will fail 
this will prevent the application to startup accidently if we were trying to import the python script to a file 

changing the default flask port to 4000



second : Yaml file 


defining two services 
- web : that will be build at the same location the file in 
defining the accessable port 9000:4000 , to be able to connect to the webapplication you will use :9000
associating the redis server to the flask application so if any change in the code happpened that will reflect directly to the web app
enabling flask debug so if anyerrors happened it will result in a messge 


- redis : this is the database server that we will use , version redis:alpine 






third : Dockerfile 

- using python 3.9-slim 
- set the main working folder inside the container to /app
- copy every thing in the working directory to the container's /app folder 
- installing everything in the file "requiremnets" 
- expose the webapp to the port 4000 
- running the application using ppython 



forth : requirements 

becuase we are going to use flask and redis for our webapp
